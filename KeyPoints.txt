The role of objects

1. Store state
2. Pass state
3. Group related functionality
4. Model real-world objects

Principles of OO programming
1.  abstraction
2.  encapsulation
3.  inheritance
4.  polymorphism


role of the class
1.  class is a blue print of an object (blueprint of the house)
2.  object follows the blueprint's structure (the house built out of blueprint)

what is in the class
1.  Fields
2.  Properties
3.  Constructor
4.  Functions/Methods


class Person {

  private _age: number;

  // GET block is used to retrieve property data
  get age(){
    return this._age;
  }

  //  SET block is used to assign data to the backing field
  set age (value: number){
  if (value>0){
    this._age = value;
    }
  }
}

/*
creating a class function/method
*/
class Person {
  placeOrder (productId: number, quantity: number) : OrderResponse{
    // code to place here
    return {
      status: true,
      orderId: 42
    }
  }
  }


  creating a class constructor
  a constructor is called when a class is instantiated to create an object

  a constructor can accept parameters that can be mapped ot the properties

  class Person {

    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;

      constructor (
            firstName: string,
            lastName: string)
    {
      this.firstName=firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
    }

  }


  automatic properties

  properties can be defined in a constructor using accessiblity modifiers(private/public)
  by using automatic property funcitonality, a property will be generated and constructor value will be mapped to it

  class Person {
    constructor (
      public firstName: string,
      public lastName: string
    ) {}
  }
